# CS 540: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This directory contains solutions I wrote for assignments for a class, 
CS 540: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
The following is a description of each program/assignment:

# assignment_1
- What is it?: a program that allows the user to manipulate a network of nodes through a GUI
- This is an exercise in: working with XML trees
- Things I implemented: src/heikal_Assmt01.java
- Main program file to run: src/heikal_Assmt01.java

# assignment_2
- What is it?: a program that builds a decision tree based on a dataset and tests it. The
dataset provided for this assignment is the voting record of members of the 1984 US House of
Representative of 16 pieces of legislation. In the test, the decision tree predicts whether a test example 
is a Republican or a Democrat based on its voting pattern.
- This is an exercise in: building a decision tree from scratch using information gain, training
a decision tree on a dataset, testing a decision tree.
- Things I implemented: src/HEIKAL_BADRULHISHAM_DecisionTree.java
- Main program file to run: src/Main.java

# assignment_3
- What is it?: a program that accepts a beginning and an end point on an OpenStreetMap and finds
a path between the two.
- This is an exercise in: implementing A* Heuristic search, working with graphs
- Things I implemented: src/HEIKAL_BADRULHISHAM_AStar.java
- Main program file to run: src/Main.java

# assignment_4
- What is it?: a program that converts propositional logic statement into conjunctive normal form, 
and performs resolution to detect and report any logical conflicts.
- This is an exercise in: converting logic, working with tree representation of logical statements
- Things I implemented: src/HEIKAL_BADRULHISHAM_Resolution.java
- Main program file to run: src/Main.java
